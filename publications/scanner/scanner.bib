abstract = {We propose neural trace photography, a novel framework to automatically learn high-quality
scanning of non-planar, complex anisotropic appearance. Our key insight is that free-form
appearance scanning can be cast as a geometry learning problem on unstructured point
clouds, each of which represents an image measurement and the corresponding acquisition
condition. Based on this connection, we carefully design a neural network, to jointly
optimize the lighting conditions to be used in acquisition, as well as the spatially
independent reconstruction of reflectance from corresponding measurements. Our framework
is not tied to a specific setup, and can adapt to various factors in a data-driven
manner. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on a number of physical
objects with a wide variation in appearance. The objects are captured with a light-weight
mobile device, consisting of a single camera and an RGB LED array. We also generalize
the framework to other common types of light sources, including a point, a linear
and an area light.},
